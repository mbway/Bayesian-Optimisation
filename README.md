# Contents #
- MLP.ipynb
    - experiment with a simple MLP
- Animation.ipynb
    - experiment with animations in jupyter
- Gaussian-Implementation.ipynb
    - experiment with my own multivariate Gaussian PDF
- Linear Regression.ipynb

# Notes #
- a neural network with infinite neurons is equivalent to a Gaussian process
- can use dropout to approximate the uncertainty of the network prediction
