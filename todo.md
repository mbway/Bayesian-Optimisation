1. Bayesian optimisation 1D
2. Bayesian optimisation 2D (synthetic)
-- make sure results are good
3. Bayesian optimisation 2D (simulated data)
4. dropout MDN
    - https://github.com/RobotsLab/AML/blob/mppi/aml_dl/src/aml_dl/mdn/model/tf_mdn_model.py
    - branch from 'mppi' first
5. maybe combine MDN with dropout?
6. maybe combine MDN with dropout and ensemble?
7. other stuff


hyperparameter cost function: just penalise bad uncertainty and hope that the model fits the dta reasonably
